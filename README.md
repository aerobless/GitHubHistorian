GitHub Historian
===============

There can be many reasons to want to delete a repository. For example if it contains old code, dangerous code or just plain crappy code that you're not proud of. Or you may need to move a project somewhere else.. and you don't want to leave outdated code laying around.  
The sad thing is, when you delete your repository on GitHub, all your commit-messages and data points in the contribution activity view are gone.  

That's why I built **GitHub Historian**. It can download the entire commit-history (author, date & message) and re-commit it into a history-repo. And yes, commits in the history-repo are date-accurate. So if you made a commit at `00:00:00 2000 - 'Fireworks *yay*'` it will appear exactly there in your "new" history-repo.

> Lose old code, **KEEP** your history.
